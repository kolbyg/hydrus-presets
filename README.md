# Hydrus Presets
These downloaders expect that you have a basic knowledge of the Hydrus Downloader system. More info can be found here: https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/getting_started_downloading.html#logins
Import these by going to network > downloaders > import downloaders, then either dragging the png onto the screen or clicking to open a file browser.

Downloaders I will likely make in the near-ish future:
- AO3 - Partially working, Hydrus does not recommend/support downloading in-progress works, which presents a problem
- IMDb - Started, no ETA


Completed Downloaders:


Tiktok - You must go to tiktok.com in your browser, then export the cookies and import them into Hydrus. This extension can make the process easy: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid

Instagram - Currently unworking due to the change that broke every other Instagram downloader
